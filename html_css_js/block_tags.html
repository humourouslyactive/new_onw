            <p>Light Yagami from Death Note displays Ni dominance. He prefers to anticipate actions, and forms elaborate plans in order to give himself a large safety net. The moment he gets a hold of the Death Note, Light sees the potential for using it to create a better world and immediately begins testing out it’s capabilities and limitations. Once discovered, he wastes no time in enacting his newfound vision. He creates traps within traps in order to protect himself and the Death Note from being discovered. For instance, he hides the Death Note within a diary, inside a trap door inside of his desk drawer, but has a way to trigger a house fire in case someone other than him accesses it. Essentially, he has three layers of contingency plans. You can see him do something similar with his bedroom door. It’s worth noting that he does all of this prior to L emerging as a threat, so it isn’t as a result of being put on the defensive, but instead a natural tendency to exercise extreme caution.</p>
